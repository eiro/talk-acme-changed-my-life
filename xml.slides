 xml editing with vim  î‚°

  notes from slcon6 demo of xml editing in vim

 please don't edit xml î‚°

  î€‹ there are many good alternatives to xml outthere (yaml, json for simple
    cases,  ...)
  î€‹ if you really target xml, please use template systems with
    alternative/decent syntax because
    î€‹ easier to write and maintain
    î€‹ if you can get the xml out of your source, it's a valid one

 pug î‚°

  î€‹ my prefered syntax is ([pug](http://pugjs.org/)).
  î€‹ there is a implementation [in rust](https://crates.io/crates/pug) so
     ðŸ¤˜ no need of millions of js files
     ðŸ¤˜ ressource efficient
     ðŸ¤˜ don't care about the first level of indentation
     ðŸ‘Ž buggy attributes support
     ðŸ‘Ž no "pretty print" option
  î€‹ [ident-object plugin](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object)
    really helps when editing pug files. Don't follow instructions in the readme
    file: use pckages instead.
